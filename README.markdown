Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard based navigation and control in the spirit of the Vim
editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Click on "Load Extension..."
3. Select the vimium directory.

The Settings page can be found by clicking the Options button next to Vimium on chrome://extensions.

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

Modifier keys are specified as <c-x>, <m-x>, <a-x> for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x
respectively. You can change any of these shortcuts under "Advanced Options".

Navigating the current page:
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    d, <c-d>, <c-e>   scroll down half a page
    u, <c-u>, <c-y>   scroll up half a page
    f       open a link in the current tab
    F       open a link in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    zi      zoom in
    zo      zoom out
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame

Using find:
    /       enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match

Navigating your history:
    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:
    J, gT      go one tab left
    K, gt      go one tab right
    t          create tab
    d          close current tab
    u          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'd' command)

Additional advanced browsing commands:
    ]]      Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    [[      Follow the link labeled 'previous' or '<'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    zH      scroll all the way left
    zL      scroll all the way right
    z0      reset zoom to default value
    <c-f>   scroll down a full page
    <c-b>   scroll up a full page


Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or
<c-[>) will clear any partial commands in the queue.

-  Some sites are now excluded by default.
-  View source (`gs`) now opens in a new tab.
-  Support for browsing paginated sites using `]]` and `[[` to go forward and backward respectively.
-  `z0` will reset the zoom level for the current page.
-  Many of the less-used commands are now marked as "advanced" and hidden in the help dialog by default, so that the core command set is more focused and approachable.
-  Bugfixes.

1.21 (10/24/2010)

-  Critical bugfix for an excluded URLs regression due to frame support.

1.20 (10/24/2010)

-  In link hints mode, holding down the shift key will now toggle between opening in the current tab and opening in a new tab.
-  Two new commands (`zH` and `zL`) to scroll to the left and right edges of the page.
-  A new command (`gi`) to focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page.
-  A new command (`<a-f>`) to open up multiple links at a time in new tabs.
-  Frame support.

-  There is a new command `goUp` (mapped to `gu` by default) that will go up one level in the URL hierarchy. For example: from http://vimium.github.com/foo/bar to http://vimium.github.com/foo. At the moment, `goUp` does not support command repetition.
